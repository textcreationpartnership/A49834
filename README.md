1. THE LAY-MAN's RELIGION, In an affectionate Epistle to all Mankind.

    _ This I shall endeavour to demonstrate in the following Discourse.

      * Of the Doctrine and Discipline of our National Church: The chief Cause and Continuance of Separation from it, arises from the Scandal of some of our Clergy, and the Immorality of some of our Members; which is the Case of the Gospel it self. The Removal of this Offence, is the proper Medium for Ʋniformity, as the only Means to unite us all against our Common Enemy.

      * Of the great Evil in bad Examples of Magistrates, Parents, and Masters of Families; and from their Neglect in their Duty.

      * But this Reformation must begin from your own Pattern and Example.

    _ I shall begin with Self-Love, the Fountain of all Evil, as that which includes all the rest; and in the first place discourse of Avarice, or Inordinate Love of the World.

      * Of the Doctrine and Discipline of our National Church: The chief Cause and Continuance of Separation from it, arises from the Scandal of some of our Clergy, and the Immorality of some of our Members; which is the Case of the Gospel it self.

      * Of the great Evil in bad Examples of Magistrates, Parents, and Masters of Families; and from their Neglect in their Duty.

      * But this Reformation must begin from your own Pattern and Example.

    _ I shall now proceed to speak of the Second; which is, Debauchery and Immorality.

      * Of the great Evil in bad Examples of Magistrates, Parents, and Masters of Families; and from their Neglect in their Duty.

      * But this Reformation must begin from your own Pattern and Example.

    _ Now let us consider the Third and last, but the most sublime and subtil sort of Moral Idolatry; or, The great Danger and Evil of Ambition and Worldly Design, under the Vizor of Zeal for Reformation; and of Liberty of Conscience and the great Abuse of it.

      * Of the great Evil in bad Examples of Magistrates, Parents, and Masters of Families; and from their Neglect in their Duty.

      * But this Reformation must begin from your own Pattern and Example.

    _ And here I may, with an humble Confidence, inforce this Argument from the greatest Example, and the most excellent Pattern; even that of His Sacred Majesty, now in the Throne, the Head of our Government, and Chief of our Communion; whose incomparable Perfections (whether we consider Him as a Man, or as a Christian) are sufficiently known to the whole World.

1. The Result of all which may be this; to put us upon a Modest Enquiry,
